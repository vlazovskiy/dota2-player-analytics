This is my final project for the Metis Introduction to Data Science class in San Francisco, Fall 2017.

For my project, I chose popular online multiplayer game DotA 2. I analyzed a player's account and looked for insights: gameplay patterns, item choices, and various in-game metrics. A detailed presentation of my project can be found here: https://prezi.com/view/s0ugsaCXBYihMsMHhExw/.

Special thanks to two great sources: https://www.dotabuff.com/ and https://github.com/joshuaduffy/dota2api (which, in turn, relies on the API provided by game developers here https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=47115)
