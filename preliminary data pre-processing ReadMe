Match details call parameters can be found in full [here](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI/GetMatchDetails).
​
Most of them are self-explanatory and do not require any additional information. However, for the purpose of working with data, I am going to copy certain parameter values here for quick reference:
​
**leaver_status**<br />
0 - NONE - finished match, no abandon.<br />
1 - DISCONNECTED - player DC, no abandon.<br />
2 - DISCONNECTED_TOO_LONG - player DC > 5min, abandoned.<br />
3 - ABANDONED - player DC, clicked leave, abandoned.<br />
4 - AFK - player AFK, abandoned.<br />
5 - NEVER_CONNECTED - player never connected, no abandon.<br />
6 - NEVER_CONNECTED_TOO_LONG - player took too long to connect, no abandon.
​
**lobby_type**
-1 - Invalid<br />
0 - Public matchmaking<br />
1 - Practise<br />
2 - Tournament<br />
3 - Tutorial<br />
4 - Co-op with bots.<br />
5 - Team match<br />
6 - Solo Queue<br />
7 - Ranked<br />
8 - 1v1 Mid<br />
​
**game_mode**<br />
0 - None<br />
1 - All Pick<br />
2 - Captain's Mode<br />
3 - Random Draft<br />
4 - Single Draft<br />
5 - All Random<br />
6 - Intro<br />
7 - Diretide<br />
8 - Reverse Captain's Mode<br />
9 - The Greeviling<br />
10 - Tutorial<br />
11 - Mid Only<br />
12 - Least Played<br />
13 - New Player Pool<br />
14 - Compendium Matchmaking<br />
15 - Co-op vs Bots<br />
16 - Captains Draft<br />
18 - Ability Draft<br />
20 - All Random Deathmatch<br />
21 - 1v1 Mid Only<br />
22 - Ranked Matchmaking<br />
​
Additionally, -1 will be assigned to all values which were not found in the API call, so if an entry that is not **lobby_type** has value of -1, that means that either the data was not available for that match, or something went wrong and requires a separate API call to look at the data.
